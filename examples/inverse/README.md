‘inverse_sim.py’ runs the simulation and will save the results as ‘.pickle’ files. 

‘inverse_sim_processing.py’ will calculate various properties from the ‘.pickle’ files including the radial distribution functions which are saved as ‘rdf_inverse.csv’. 

‘inverse_plotting’ will generate final processed plots. 

‘inverse_heatmaps.py’ generates heatmaps showing the irradiation intensity on the surface (also using the ‘.pickle’ files).
