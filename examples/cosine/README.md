Code for simulation can be found in the github repo/examples/cosine. 

‘cosine_sim.py’ runs the simulation and will save the results as ‘.pickle’ files. 

‘cosine_plotting’ will use the ‘.pickle’ files and generate final processed plots. 

‘cosine_heatmaps.py’ generates heatmaps showing the irradiation intensity on the surface (also using the ‘.pickle’ files).
